# Portfolio [Website](emielvanseveren.be)

Hi if you're reading this you probably wanted to checkout what this portfolio repository is. Well obviously it's the code for my portfolio website. A small application I created for a school assignment and because I enjoy to.

It consists out of a react frontend and minimally served with koa as it just needs to serve static files.

# Portfolio [Website](emielvanseveren.be)

Hi if you're reading this you probably wanted to checkout what this portfolio repository is. Well obviously it's the code for my portfolio website. A small application I created for a school assignment and because I enjoy it.

It consists out of a react frontend and served with koa, as it just needs to serve static files.
Click [here](emielvanseveren.be), or in the title to visit the website.

Don't forget to click ;)
